**ColorV** is a vim plugin tries to make colors handling easier.
   
    For example:
    When editing text like '#9370D8' or 'LightSlateGray' or 'rgb(216,112,147)'
    We want to view it's actual color, and pick the actual color we want.

    ColorV helps you doing this.

    Press '<leader>ce'(':ColorVEdit') in 'LightSlateGray',
    this will open ColorV window showing the text's color.
    And after picking a color and close the window,
    The text will be changed to your picked color.

    Features:
    View, Edit, Preview, Generate, Pick, Mark ... Colors and more.
